albania.ankara_conference.t: "The Ankara Conference"
albania.ankara_conference.desc: "After several weeks of tense diplomatic negotiations, we finally reached an agreement with Turkish representatives to meet in Ankara. The main goal was to assess their resources and discuss potential cooperation that could strengthen our country and the region. We arrived on time, fully prepared with all necessary documentation and strategic plans, expecting an honest dialogue. However, as the hours passed, it became clear that the Turkish delegation had no intention of showing up. There were no representatives, no apologies, no notice of postponement. This blatant disregard for our efforts and for the status of our nation was evident. The carefully planned meeting turned into a hollow formality — an empty hall, silence, and a feeling of deep disrespect. Such behavior not only demonstrates contempt for our diplomatic efforts but also suggests that Turkey does not see us as an equal partner. We must respond firmly to show the strength and resolve of our nation."

albania.ankara_conference.tt: "The focus 'ALB_FearDeath' is completed. We have shown that we will not tolerate disrespect and will act decisively in response to hostile actions from other states."
